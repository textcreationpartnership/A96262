            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:151859:7"/>upon: He told me <hi>him≈øelf had been pre≈øent at them, and that two of the three were already dead; but that the Doctor</hi> (as he called him) <hi>told him the third was alive, though run away; however,</hi> he believed him to have accompanied the re≈øt, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe told the <hi>Doctor</hi> that <hi>it was like to prove a fatal Campagne for Brutes,</hi> but <hi>hoped it would be a better for Mankind.</hi> He withal told me, that my <hi>Lord</hi> was ≈øufficiently weary of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, and believed he would take no farther notice of him: As for the Souldier, all that knew his Condition, believed his greate≈øt Danger to con≈øi≈øt in that of his having fallen into ≈øuch Hands, whatever Excu≈øe he is able to coin to the contrary.</p>
            <p>I believe he ≈øpeaks true in ≈øaying, <hi>that his Failing in his Preten≈øions was the Cau≈øe why his Maje≈øty did not
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:151859:7"/>then imploy him.</hi> I am ≈øure if he be right informed, he hath the ≈øame or more ≈øtill.</p>
            <p>He ≈øays <hi>of all the Patients he had in</hi> Flanders, <hi>there was but one died.</hi> And truly that was no great Wonder, con≈øidering the Smalne≈øs of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: however, perhaps it may be found to be a Mi≈øtake by and by.</p>
            <p>I am ≈øo far from doubting the Truth of Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi>'s Di≈øcovering his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Medicine to be a con≈øiderable Cau≈øtick, that I am able to demon≈øtrate it again≈øt all Oppo≈øition; for until by its frequent Application there be a <hi>Cru≈øt</hi> or <hi>E≈øchare</hi> induced upon the Part, his Patients never fail to complain of intolerable gnawing Pains: By which he fearing his Medicine's falling into Di≈øgrace, was generally obliged to allay its Sharpne≈øs by a little Smart-Money, as we ≈øhall hear by and by.</p>
            <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:151859:8"/>
            <p>In his next Paragraph he ≈øays, <hi>his Medicines cure all Wounds without Suppuration; but Suppuration once begun, they are incomparable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øtives.</hi> But this is no more than one of his accu≈øtomed Contradictions, in ≈øaying, that a thing is the mo≈øt improper, and yet the mo≈øt proper for producing the ≈øame effect.</p>
            <p>As for his treating of Gun-≈øhot Wounds where the Bones are ≈øhattered, he ≈øays, by his Method, the bringing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the Splinters is neither hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous nor trouble≈øom. By which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand he is changeable in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for my ≈øelf, and ≈øeveral others not long ≈øince, have heard him affirm, that <hi>there was no Occa≈øion for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of any ≈øuch Splinters; for that by Virtue of his Medicine, he could bring them to a Reunion in a very
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:151859:8"/>≈ømall time.</hi> But his ninth Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ≈øeems to have taught him more Wit: He ≈øays <hi>he might have enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Number of his Experiments:</hi> And truly ≈øo he might, with the ≈øame Ju≈øtice he hath u≈øed them, as we ≈øhall ≈øee hereafter. As for his Stopping great Fluxes of Blood, we ≈øhall refer him to his <hi>thirteeenth Experiment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as for <hi>his being poi≈øoned,</hi> I could never find even his be≈øt Friends inclinable to give any Credit to it, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than believing him (by a Mi≈øtake) to have upon a certain time taken ≈øome of his own Tincture, for the trial of an Experiment; and it's very probable that his two Friends might be as ignorant as him≈øelf: however, it is certain that it is capable to produce all tho≈øe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of Poi≈øoning, which either him≈øelf or his Friends pretended to have. Nor was it at all likely that any Per≈øon
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:151859:9"/>(how wicked ≈øoever) ≈øhould either trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or hazard them≈øelves by ≈øuch an Action, con≈øidering that any one (though never ≈øo ≈øhort-≈øighted) mu≈øt needs di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Period of his already expiring Preten≈øions: Neverthele≈øs, him≈øelf cannot di≈øown his having very ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved of ≈øeveral, or almo≈øt all Per≈øons of that Profe≈ø≈øion. For in≈øtance; A Souldier in the Engli≈øh Guards having received a con≈øiderable Wound in the Brea≈øt, his Officer ≈øent for Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch:</hi> But in the interim, Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> Chirurgion to the Regiment, came and dre≈ø≈øed the Patient after the u≈øual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Soon after Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> came; who without any regard to the former Dre≈ø≈øing, was going to make his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. But not being ≈øuffered by Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> he went away and maliciou≈øly reported to many Per≈øons in the Camp, that the Man was dead for want of his Application: Be≈øides others, he repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:151859:9"/>this to the Major and two Captains of the Fu≈øileers; who ≈øending next Morning to inform them≈øelves of the Truth, were ≈øatisfied to his no ≈ømall Di≈øgrace, that the Souldier had not only e≈øcaped all Danger of Death, but even that of his Hands: But this is but one of many.</p>
            <p>The Rea≈øon, as he ≈øaith, why he hath u≈øed ≈øo few Terms of Art, is, becau≈øe he de≈øigns Plainne≈øs; but I ≈øay it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he had none, except he hath very lately got them. In my Opinion he is very excu≈øable in not mentioning what his Medicines are, becau≈øe the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of them would not only derogate from their Reputation, which is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ≈øupported by this Secrecy, but al≈øo impede their Vending, which is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's chief De≈øign.</p>
            <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:151859:10"/>
            <p>Now at la≈øt he is de≈øigned to give the World an extraordinary Ta≈øte of his Mode≈øty and Civility, in vouch≈øafing to rank him≈øelf amongst ≈øuch Per≈øons as <hi>Helmont, Willis, Needham;</hi> and does tell us, that his Authority is no le≈øs ≈øufficient to recommend a Medicine (though unknown to the World, and even him≈øelf too) than any of theirs was.</p>

            <p>THE far greater Part of this Treati≈øe (which I am now about to make ≈øome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon) ≈øeems rather de≈øigned for the Amu≈øement of the unthinking Reader, and ≈øwelling of the Book to ≈øuch a convenient Bulk, as may in ≈øome mea≈øure conceal the Defect and Barrenne≈øs of its Author's Inventions, than either the ≈øupport of an old, or the laying down of any new <hi>Hypothe≈øis;</hi> which though he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily promi≈øes, he no where performs that which he pretends to, being no more than an incoherent, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent, mangled, nay even murdred
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:151859:11"/>Parcel of Collections, and many of tho≈øe neither from the fir≈øt nor be≈øt hands.</p>
            <p>After ≈øome, as ≈øilly as impertinent Reflections upon Surgeons and their Methods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ≈øays, that his pre≈øent Undertaking will be altogether mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and imperfect, without giving us fir≈øt ≈øome Account of <hi>Nutrition;</hi> and truly I may ≈øay ≈øo it is with it.</p>
            <p>At fir≈øt glance I expected he would begin with the Nutrition of a <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb; but I doubt he was afraid of an Abortion, which hath made him change his Subject into that of an <hi>Adult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>in his <hi>3d</hi> and <hi>5th Pages</hi> he goes on with this Account, without the lea≈øt mentioning any of tho≈øe Authors Names from whom he ≈øtole it.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>6th</hi> and <hi>7th Pages,</hi> he talks confu≈øedly of Fire in the Blood, and ≈øeems to incline ≈øomewhat to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of it; but not daring to allow it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151859:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>either <hi>Wood, Turff,</hi> or <hi>Sea-Coal,</hi> is not a little troubled to find a <hi>Pabulum</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>8th</hi> and <hi>9th Pages,</hi> he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken too much pains in making and an≈øwering an Objection, which mu≈øt by and by fall together. For if by <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> he means that which is ≈øuppurated from Wounds, the Objection is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fal≈øe; for ≈øo ≈øoon as a Wound begins to matter, the Fever for the mo≈øt pa≈øt remits. If this be not his Meaning, I doubt neither of us know it. He ≈øeems likewi≈øe at no ≈ømall lo≈øs about the Rea≈øons of ≈øo great and ≈øudden Wa≈øte made upon fat Per≈øons by violent Fevers, if there be no Flame in the Blood: but that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from his Ignorance of the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Oeconomy,</hi> together with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulne≈øs of <hi>Sanctorius</hi>'s Experiment, which him≈øelf is to mention by and by.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>10th</hi> he goes on with his Story, more confu≈øed than the Liquor he is there plea≈øed to term ≈øo.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:151859:12"/>
            <p>But I cannot omit taking notice of his Civility to <hi>Sanctorius</hi> in his <hi>11th Page,</hi> in allowing him the Honour of his own Ob≈øervation, becau≈øe it is more than he hath done to any other Per≈øon hitherto in all his Account, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Sanguification or Nutrition, though it be all at be≈øt but borrowed, and much of it at ≈øecond hand.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>12th</hi> he carries on his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of Nutrition by the <hi>Serum;</hi> but hath borrowed ≈øo much Mode≈øty as to own his Ignorance of Nature's adapting the Pores and Particles to each other for that Purpo≈øe; by which Means he hath ≈øaved me the labour of doing it for him.</p>
            <p>His <hi>13th, 14th</hi> and <hi>15th,</hi> are taken up with Three Experiments, which he brings for the Proof of all Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles being nouri≈øhed by Water only: the fir≈øt ≈øeems to be from ≈øome <hi>Hone≈øt Gardiner,</hi> the ≈øecond is <hi>Helmont's,</hi> and the third the <hi>Famous Boyle</hi>'s.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:151859:12"/>
            <p>I am fully ≈øatisfied they are the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt and be≈øt part of his Book; and therefore ≈øhall neither repeat nor quarrel at them, they being already ≈øufficiently injured by coming thro' his hands.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>16th,</hi> when the danger is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt over, he is fallen into an inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Difficulty; which ≈øince him≈øelf pretends no where to remove, I hope will have the Patience to ≈øee the total Subver≈øion and utter Ruine of his ill built, and wor≈øe ≈øupported Hypothe≈øis.</p>
            <p>The Difficulty is this; That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding all Vegetables have their Nutrition and Increa≈øe from Water only, do neverthele≈øs afford us ≈øuch Sub≈øtances as are neither ea≈øily mixed with, nor indeed obtainable from Water.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>17th Page</hi> he ≈øays, that <hi>he thinks</hi> there is no Difference, only <hi>≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum Majus &amp; Minus,</hi> between tho≈øe Wa≈øtes made by in≈øen≈øible Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpiration
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151859:13"/>which are natural, and a Wound made by Force which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural. Had he not ≈øaid <hi>he thought,</hi> I ≈øhould have thought he ≈øpoke <hi>ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> meaning all the Difference in the World: I am ≈øure I think ≈øo, for</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, There is a <hi>material</hi> Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; that which we wa≈øte by in≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible Tran≈øpiration being thin, volatile and excrementitious; but this which Nature doth ≈øupply for the re-union of a divided Sub≈øtance, a Juice <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øamick fixed,</hi> and nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a <hi>formal</hi> Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: for,</p>
            <p>In in≈øen≈øible Tran≈øpiration the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia</hi> can make no Digre≈ø≈øion in their Pa≈ø≈øage along the <hi>Fibres,</hi> until they e≈øcape by the Pores of the Cuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; but in a Wound the mentioned Juice drilling along the <hi>Fibres</hi> after its accu≈øtomed manner, until it comes to the Divi≈øion, where it immediately drops down, without ≈øome previous
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151859:13"/>Information from his Almighty Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>But now he ≈øeems to de≈øign ≈øome faint Approaches to the Matter: he ≈øuppo≈øes a Wound to be made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here are ≈øo many ≈øuppo≈øitions, that they require to be ≈øummed up together:</p>
            <p>In the <hi>17th, When there is a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>18th, Suppo≈øe a Divi≈øion to be made, and it's no matter where.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ≈øame <hi>Page, Now let a Wound be made where it will, and how, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the <hi>20th,</hi> we are come to the fourth, and I hope la≈øt Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition: for the other three have been very u≈øele≈øs and impertinent.</p>
            <p>He ≈øays, <hi>Let a Divi≈øion be made in any of the Parts of the Body, which we call a Wound; and how it's made it matters not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:151859:14"/>
            <p>
               <hi>The nutritious Juice is immediately brought to the Ends of the wounded Ve≈ø≈øels:</hi> For their Reparation and Reunion, which (as he ≈øays) would ≈øoon be effected were not <hi>Nature op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed, and her regular Operations im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded,</hi> by the common Methods and Medicines of Chirurgions.</p>
            <p>Now although almo≈øt every Page be larded with ≈øuch groundle≈øs A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øions upon Chirurgions and their Medicines, I ≈øhall this once for all, a little weigh and con≈øider the Rea≈øons which he hath brought again≈øt the common Methods and Medicines; as al≈øo tho≈øe which may be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt his particular Method and Medicine.</p>
            <p>And fir≈øt he ≈øays, <hi>the common are of that Nature that they greatly relax the divided Fibres; ≈øo that they cannot contain the nutritive Matter brought to them, but let it pa≈øs into the Wound:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:151859:14"/>where it is by the ≈øame Medicines, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and turned into Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I an≈øwer; If by relaxing, he means mollifying, re≈øtoring, and reducing the Ends of the≈øe Fibres; who being irritated by the Sen≈øe of ≈øome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Injury, had convul≈øed and retired them≈øelves from their proper Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Offices; we ≈øhall make no great Difficulty to acknowledg it both the Effect, and ≈øome part of the De≈øign of our common Medicine.</p>
            <p>But if by relaxing, he means the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of the Fibres to a more than ordinary or convenient Widene≈øs: I an≈øwer; They have but little Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency ≈øo to do, becau≈øe the mo≈øt part of our dige≈øtive Medicines con≈øi≈øt of con≈øiderably Re≈øtringent, Anodyne and Empla≈øtick Parts: and therefore (except very well malaxed) are not capable of in≈øinuating them≈øelves into the Fibres to that degree which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven convenient for the Exclu≈øion of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151859:15"/>the ≈øharper part of the Air, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of which is often-times the Cau≈øe of a total Ob≈øtruction.</p>
            <p>But next, <hi>when the Matter is pa≈ø≈øed into the Wound,</hi> let us ≈øee what Power the afore≈øaid Medicine hath to bring it to Corruption; which him≈øelf ≈øays, <hi>cannot be brought to pa≈øs without a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ≈øhall ≈øuppo≈øe our common Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to be <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and the <hi>Yolk of an Egg:</hi> Now every one knows that neither of the≈øe apart, nor both of them together, have the lea≈øt Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the producing of any of the five Sorts of Fermentation; nay, (as was hinted before) they con≈øi≈øting of ≈øuch Parts, are ≈øo far from being the Cau≈øe of, that they naturally and powerfully oppo≈øe them≈øelves unto, the very lea≈øt Appearance sof it, even in the nutritive Juice it ≈øelf ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times di≈øpo≈øed that way.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:151859:15"/>
            <p>Nor is there any thing more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable, con≈øidering that the Branches of the Sulphur are at all times ready to engage, ≈øheath and detain the ≈øharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Acids; by which there nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øarily follows a <hi>Coagulation,</hi> the mo≈øt oppo≈øite Act in Nature to <hi>Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have one thing more to add con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our common Medicine; and it is, that neither Tincture, Solution, nor Pouder, nor any other thing of a different Body, is either able to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply its Place, or an≈øwer its Intention in any Fle≈øh-Wound, where there is con≈øiderable lo≈øs of Sub≈øtance.</p>
            <p>For by its <hi>analogous</hi> Sub≈øtance and Conveniency of Body, it in ≈øome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure ≈øupplies the lo≈øs of Sub≈øtance by giving a Conveniency to the Fibres to enlarge them≈øelves betwixt the Branches of its Body; and by this means not only cheri≈øheth them by its natural Warmth, but ≈øupports
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:151859:16"/>their (as yet young and tender) Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, until the Reunion be wholly perfected. An In≈øtance of which is plainly to be ≈øeen where the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our Medicine is continued (though never ≈øo ≈øhort while) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its due time, in encouraging In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation to a more than convenient degree.</p>
            <p>Now ≈øince I have (as I hope) more than ≈øufficiently vindicated our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, both by Experience and Rea≈øon, from tho≈øe unju≈øt A≈øper≈øions which our <hi>Antagoni≈øt</hi> hath ca≈øt upon it without either, it may not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to take a View of the Effects of his Medicine al≈øo in this place.</p>
            <p>In the fir≈øt place I ≈øhall readily di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it from the fir≈øt Particular which our Meidcine is charged with, viz. <hi>Relaxing of the Fibres,</hi> and ≈øhall make appear it only corrodes them.</p>
            <p>Let us know, ≈øecondly, whether it <hi>corrupts the nutritive Juice by cau≈øing a Fermentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:151859:16"/>
            <p>I am ≈øure if a corro≈øive Acid, that's ready to quarrel with even Metals them≈øelves, can contribute, it is not wanting: But if once it enter into the Ma≈øs of Blood, in≈øtead of dividing its Texture, it will go near to petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy it; and after that, there is no fear of a Fever either intermitting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall ≈øum up its Effects in a few words; being applied to a recent Wound, the Acid Particles imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fix them≈øelves into the mo≈øt ≈øen≈øible Parts, cau≈øing them to retire by way of Convul≈øion as far as it is po≈ø≈øible for them, and forcing them to excern all they contain in or about their Orifices: if the fir≈øt fails, a ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Application induces an <hi>E≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char,</hi> except it be diluted with an extraordinary quantity of Water; and then it only keeps the Place raw, and as him≈øelf ≈øays, <hi>without any good Dige≈øtion;</hi> but if applied to a Bone,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151859:17"/>it is infallibly condemned to a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Exfoliation, as you may ≈øee in his <hi>9th Experiment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ≈øcarce any room or time now to take notice of his Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øance to the <hi>Gentleman who writ that late Learned Treati≈øe of Intermitting Fevers,</hi> ≈øince he ab≈øolutely pretends to be the only competent Judg; I ≈øhall only ≈øay that <hi>he</hi> who hath the Honour of his good Opinion, is not ≈øo much obliged to him for it, as <hi>tho≈øe</hi> who have formerly treated of that Subject, are unmannerly and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly cen≈øured by him.</p>
            <p>He goes on in his <hi>23d and 24th Pages</hi> with a deal of fal≈øe Suppo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without the lea≈øt Pretence to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ju≈øtice or Rea≈øon, and therefore ≈øhall receive no An≈øwer.</p>

               <hi>And if tho≈øe Hazards attend the Cure of external Fle≈øh-Wounds, what is to be expected in Wounds within the Cavity of the Body, where the Lungs, Liver,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are wounded?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I an≈øwer; I look upon them at lea≈øt to be mortal if they meet with no other Treatment than what either he or his <hi>Medicine</hi> is able to afford them.</p>
            <p>He likewi≈øe ≈øays, that if any ≈øuch Accident come to be cured, the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon</hi> looks upon it as a Miracle, and in no re≈øpect to be attributed either to his own Intention or Judgment.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer; His Mi≈øtake proceeds from his little Reading, and le≈øs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe with Men of Sen≈øe and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in that Profe≈ø≈øion; any one of them being able to give him more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances of Cures of that Nature, and Rea≈øons for them, than ever he ≈øaw Wounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to bring a Wound in the Lungs, Liver or Guts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to Suppuration,</hi> he ≈øays, <hi>brings certain Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:151859:18"/>
            <p>If the poor Man knew what <hi>Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> were, he would never harp ≈øo much upon that ≈øtring, it being no more than what him≈øelf hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently owned, though under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name, <hi>viz.</hi> the bringing of the nutritious Juice to the Ends of the divided Fibres, or the ouzing out of ≈øome little Blood, or other Liquor, from their proper Ve≈ø≈øels.</p>
            <p>But perhaps he will object, That it is not the bringing of it to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, but its pa≈ø≈øing into the Wound which he quarrels at.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer; To ≈øuppo≈øe that Juice or other Liquor to have been natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally accu≈øtomed to drill along the Fibres before their Divi≈øion, and now to ≈øtop exactly at the Divi≈øion, and go no further, were to allow it a greater ≈øhare of Sen≈øe, nay Rea≈øon, than him≈øelf can pretend to.</p>
            <p>The re≈øt of the <hi>Page</hi> is not worth reading, further than to let one know
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151859:18"/>that it is ≈øo. But here comes the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the <hi>twenty 6th Page,</hi> how to ≈øtop the Blood when a large Blood-Ve≈ø≈øel is wounded.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer; It mu≈øt be by other means than his Pouder; for although it be a con≈øiderable Cau≈øtick, it is not ≈øufficient for that purpo≈øe, as we ≈øhall ≈øee in the <hi>13th Experiment,</hi> and el≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>He is much mi≈øtaken when he ≈øays, that upon the <hi>≈ølighte≈øt Occa≈øion we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways confine our Patients to a low Diet, and let them blood:</hi> For we never do either, without apparent Rea≈øons.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>twenty 7th</hi> he hath a notable Di≈øh of <hi>Billing≈øgate,</hi> and ought to have had Oi≈øter-Sauce e're it had been pre≈øented the King's Table.</p>
            <p>He omits <hi>Bandages</hi> as being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unnece≈ø≈øary;a nd truly ≈øo they are to his Intention, except it were one to hang him≈øelf withal ≈øo ≈øoon as he is a little more fully di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the World.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:151859:19"/>
            <p>In his <hi>twenty 9th Page</hi> he gives an Account of his <hi>Method of Cure.</hi> Which hath ≈øeveral Pieces of Rarity in it.</p>
            <p>For Fir≈øt, It never was nor will be made u≈øe of by any other Per≈øon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He ≈øtitches clo≈øe up all Wounds without di≈øtinction, even <hi>Gun-≈øhot Wounds</hi> them≈øelves.</p>
            <p>The re≈øt of his Book (for want of better Stuff) is filled up with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of as fal≈øe as unrea≈øonable A≈ø≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, prai≈øing his own, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our Medicines; but of tho≈øe enough already.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall only touch a few of them as we go along, by retorting ≈øome, and laughing at others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> His external Medicine cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes exce≈ø≈øive Pain when fir≈øt applied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is always a con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable deal of Pain afterwards, and the Parts ≈øo ≈øtiff and ≈øore, as if they never would be well.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:151859:19"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If there hath been no Pain at all before, it never fails in a few Moments after the Application to bring a troop of ill Symptoms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Part; ≈øuch as Swellings, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammodons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which (by the way) is a ≈øure Argument that it is a ≈øharp Medicine, and a Cau≈øtick, though he deny it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> His Medicine hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Fever for its Companion: for ≈øeveral People who have been woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and by our Medicine brought to a fair way of Recovery, have in a very ≈ømall time by the u≈øe of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine been thrown into Fevers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with violent Pains in the Parts.</p>
            <p>And again; The ≈øame Per≈øons by quitting of his Method and Medicine, and u≈øing of ours, have been as ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly recovered: As may be ≈øeen in our <hi>15th</hi> Remark. The fifth being only a Repetition, I ≈øhall take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:151859:20"/>
            <p>In his <hi>thirty 4th Page</hi> he makes and an≈øwers a terrible Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> How it's po≈ø≈øible for him, without bringing a Wound to Suppuration, to obtain the Di≈øcharge of extraneous Bodies; ≈øuch as Bullets, Clothes, Splinters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ≈øhall ≈øoon an≈øwer that for him: He hath in his <hi>Method of Cure</hi> ≈øtitched them all hard up long ago, for fear they ≈øhould have been kept open by tenting. Pa≈ø≈øing his other Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we come to his In≈øtance in the <hi>thirty 6th Page</hi> of two Officers of the Fu≈øileers; the Matter of Fact to my certain Knowledg was thus:</p>
            <p>Lieutenant <hi>Fletcher,</hi> the Subject of hsi <hi>4th Experiment,</hi> being one of them, we ≈øhall refer him to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> upon that <hi>Experiment;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was wounded with a hollow Blade, the Point entred a little above the <hi>Carpus,</hi> or Wri≈øt, on the under and in≈øide; ≈øo pa≈ø≈øing under the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:151859:20"/>and rubbing upon ≈øeveral of the Tendons and Radius, came out about five or ≈øix Inches upwards from its Entrance.</p>
            <p>The≈øe two Gentlemen were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at one time; and although the Doctor is plea≈øed to ≈øhew his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ≈øaying the latter was ≈ølightly wounded, he will neverthele≈øs to any unprejudiced Per≈øon plainly appear to have been more dangerou≈øly wounded than the other: He was dre≈ø≈øed by the <hi>Surgeon</hi> to the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and although about the <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth</hi> Day there came a Swelling, and ≈øome Inflammation upon the Part, and that by the <hi>Gentleman's</hi> owned Neglect, yet that was in le≈øs than <hi>twenty four Hours</hi> removed, and the Gentleman (whatever the Doctor fal≈øly and maliciou≈øly reports to the contrary) was in le≈øs than <hi>three Weeks</hi> perfectly well.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:151859:21"/>
            <p>He goes on in the <hi>thirty 7th and thirty 8th Pages</hi> with the already thread-bare Encomiums of his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; and after a needle≈øs Caution, forbidding us to believe that he can work Miracles, he refers us for the Proof of all to the fourteen follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>SExperiments;</hi> which are to him like <hi>Samp≈øon</hi>'s Locks: but I ≈øuppo≈øe with this Difference, that if once they be cut off, they are never like to grow again.</p>
            <p>Although ≈øome part of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Experiments have been hitherto Stranger to my Ears, (though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon the Place where they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have been acted) I ≈øhall not therefore conclude that there never were ≈øuch Per≈øon in being as the Subjects of them: neverthele≈øs, I may (I hope) without breach of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mode≈øty or Charity, be bold to affirm, (and that uupon good Grounds) that the Matter of Fact in all of them
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151859:21"/>is very much different from that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the Learned <hi>Author</hi> is here plea≈øed to make us: For,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Such of his <hi>Experiments</hi> which either my own Eyes, or tho≈øe of my unque≈øtionable Evidences have been Witne≈ø≈øes to, are as far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true as rea≈øonable; as we ≈øhall ≈øee in their proper place.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Names</hi> of, and his <hi>Experiments</hi> upon all Per≈øons who have mi≈øcarried under his hand, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecially ≈øuch as every one may ea≈øily inform them≈øelves of the Truth of) are by him utterly ≈øuppre≈øs'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Improbability, nay Impo≈ø≈øibility, which attends the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt part of his Relations mu≈øt needs be no ≈ømall Impediment to their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, with any con≈øiderate and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Per≈øon.</p>
            <p>Neverthele≈øs, I ≈øhall not any where in my Remarks upon his following
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151859:22"/>Experiments, contradict his pretended Matter of Fact, excepting ≈øuch as I am able to bring undoubted Proof to the contrary.</p>
            <p>For the re≈øt, I ≈øhall only <hi>(en pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant)</hi> ob≈øerve ≈øome few of his many as well Improbabilities as Incon≈øi≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>

               <p>The Matter of Fact is; The Per≈øon of the ≈øame <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Regiment</hi> which he relates, was run into the Brea≈øt: the Surgeon to the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ≈øounding of the Wound with his Probe, and being alarmed with the rebutting of it by the <hi>Sy≈øtole</hi> and <hi>Dia≈øtole</hi> of the Heart, did thence ra≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and incon≈øiderately conclude that the Wound mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the Cavity; never con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that even the laying of a <hi>Probe</hi> (or the like) upon the Region of the Heart (though without the Skin)

               <p>I ≈øhould be unpardonable if I ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the World to be impo≈øed upon in this and the following Experiment, having been Eye-witne≈øs to the whole Matter of Fact in both: this pre≈øent was thus: One <hi>John Wyles</hi> in the Regiment of the Honourable Lord <hi>George Hamilton,</hi> in the Company of Capt. <hi>Hay</hi>'s, was upon the <hi>twenty fir≈øt</hi> of <hi>July</hi> Old Stile, ≈øher in the Back of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:151859:27"/>the Hand; the Bullet entred betwixt that Bone of the <hi>Metacarp</hi> which ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtains the Middle and that which ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtains the Ring-finger, gra≈øing upon the latter as it entred, broke the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and in coming out rubb'd upon that which ≈øu≈øtains the Fore-finger. I went with one of his Officers to ≈øee him next Morning; and he told me he had been dre≈ø≈øed, but complained of intolerable Pain: Three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I made him another vi≈øit, but he had not then been dre≈ø≈øed a ≈øecond time. However, the fir≈øt had ≈øo ting'd the Bandage, and every thing el≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, that it was no hard matter to conclude it a Vitriolike Medicine. I ≈øaw it ≈øeveral times after wards, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ≈øame colour, and a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Flux of crude undige≈øted Matter coming from it: When I ≈øaw it about a Fortnight after, both Orifices were much contracted, and ≈øome little ≈øpungy Excre≈øcences in the Form of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:151859:28"/>≈ømall Bramble-berries, ≈øhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves about its Circumference, with ≈øtill the ≈øame quantity and ≈øort of Matter; and the Patient always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of intolerable Pains after dre≈ø≈øing, which had then been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>four times;</hi> and then the Hand began to ≈øwell con≈øiderably.</p>
               <p>I vi≈øited him again the <hi>Twentieth</hi> of <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> with the Chaplain to the Regiment and ≈øeveral others: I then found his Hand prodigiou≈øly ≈øwelled ≈øo, that he could not ≈øo much as move one of his Fingers. I asked him how he found it? He an≈øwered me <hi>very well,</hi> to my no ≈ømall Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: But looking about, and ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øome of his Tent-mates, I asked them if he was not di≈øtracted? But they <hi>(laughing)</hi> told me, <hi>that e're I came the Doctor had been there, and given him two Shillings upon Condition he ≈øhould make that An≈øwer to any one who ≈øhould ask him how he did.</hi> The
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:151859:28"/>
                  <hi>Per≈øon</hi> him≈øelf being taxed with it, could not deny it; but this he did al≈øo to his <hi>Comerade</hi> in the next Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, and ≈øeveral others.</p>
               <p>This was at the Camp at <hi>Wining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and after <hi>the long March</hi> which he mentions; neither had it at that time di≈øcharged any of that va≈øt number of Bones which him≈øelf ≈øays it di≈øcharged afterwards, nor do I believe 'tis well to this day.</p>

               <p>'Tis true, that after ≈øome time there happened a fre≈øh Flux of Blood, which was the Occa≈øion that <hi>he</hi> was called, but (at lea≈øt) mi≈øtakes when he ≈øays they u≈øed red hot irons to ≈øtop it; though I do believe they had better done it, than tru≈øted to his Pouder, as they did to the (at lea≈øt) anticipating their Patient's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction.</p>
               <p>His Arm was but little ≈øwell'd, and not at all mortified; nor did he lo≈øt (before that time) one ≈øixth part of the Blood which he mentions. When he came fir≈øt to the Patient, he was asked by Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> whether
